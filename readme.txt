1. The Boruta.R file is the first layer of feature selection. It needs to read the IC50 value of cancer patients and genome information including gene mutation (mut), chromosome variation (rna) and copy number variation (cnv), and output the first layer of features Feature file after selection.
2. The mrmr.R file is the second layer of feature selection. It needs to read the feature matrix obtained after the first layer of feature selection. The final feature dimension of the second layer of feature selection is optional, which can be changed according to the needs, and the final output A signature file containing IC50 tag values for the corresponding dimension.
3. XGBoost-GLM-AIC.R is the last layer of feature selection. It needs to read the feature matrix obtained after the second layer of feature selection. After ten-fold cross-validation, the GLM prediction result is obtained and saved, and the GLM model is attached. AIC criterion test for exponential family distributions.
4. The ANN.R file is a neural network model. It needs to read in the feature matrix obtained after the second layer of feature selection. After ten-fold cross-validation, the ANN prediction result is obtained and saved.
5. The drug-mogan.R file calculates the Mogan molecular fingerprint of the drug, which needs to read the drug structure file downloaded from Pubchem, and output the Mogan molecular fingerprint of the drug.
6. The qujian.R file contains the confidence interval functions of various exponential family distributions required by the model.
7. The plot figure.R file contains various drawing instructions and confidence interval coverage functions.
